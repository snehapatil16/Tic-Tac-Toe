# TicTacToe

This project implements the tic-tac-toe game that interacts with the players through the console and through an interactive window.

# Part 1- A console/keyboard version:
This program consists of two classes: TicTacToeBoard, and TicTacToeConsoleGame.
Use -1 to indicate that the position is occupied by X, 1 to indicate that the position is occupied by O, and 0 to indicate the position is empty.


# Part 2:
A new class: TicTacToeGraphicalGame.
Each user clicks on a square to indicate which spot they want to occupy. It manages turn-taking, and tells the user the outcome when the game is over.
